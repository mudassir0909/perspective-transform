_code is a bit scratchy atm (shall refine it)_

Left panel has images that you want to transform. #source-image

Right panel has image that you want the transformation to **happen on** #target-image


### How to

Draw a rectangle on the target image by click 4 points anywhere on the target image & the selected image from the left panel gets transformed on to that invisible rectangle. Try transforming some images on to the billboard by clicking it's four corners :)
